Flag: CTF{caesarcipherisasubstitutioncipher}

Tried to use gocr to grab text from image however the translation was very broken. The correct rotation was barely recognizable.
Could probably revisit this in the future, try to crop just the flag and enlarge and sharpen the image.
For this attempt, I just typed out the text into a rot13 website to get the flag.
